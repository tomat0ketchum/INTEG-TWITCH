I had to check - I followed you 5 years ago ;) glad to see you back suffering in league with us lol
I do not like this voice lmao - and the AI isn't very detailed so far from what I've heard, but I'm also working and missing bits
Yeah, I have been lurking on and off since you came back and saw you set the voices up. I guess I finally spoke up and it doomed me with this voice
I missed that part :p
what elo are you at right now lol
I peaked diamond last season yet I'm stuck in Gold this season as a support main...life is tough...
that was a wild escape
aren't there 3 splits this season?
there were 2 last year but I heard there's 3 now
I'm getting yelled at for working here quietly :(
Beta who is the best support to solo climb with in League?
