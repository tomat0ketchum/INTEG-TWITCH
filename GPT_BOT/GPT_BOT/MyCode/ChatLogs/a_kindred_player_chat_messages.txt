gives you more ad
it's funny how the highest wr options there have the highest wrs
ad*
Ochams razer "the simplest explanations is usually the correct one"
More ad > More damage
what good is more as if you have no damage
so what you're telling me is, with Statik shive > PD you dont have enough AS?
in what way? does it synergize better?
I'm going to be honest, it sounds like a complete bait item
All i know every zeri player i've had in my games, always is confused about their lack of damage, and their build is always the same.
Look, try thie build this game
i'll watch
Statik Shive > PD > Navori or IE
Or Try Storm Razer > Runnans > IE
do the stormrazer > Ruunans > IE
actually, i'm going to cook...   Build this: Kraken > Ruunans > Navori
Kindred will be good for good kindred players
crit is hard to play if you're bad
Kraken first item will still be her first item most likely, deals more damage lower health they are, and more move speed is great on her
The reason this build will be better: Kraken has on hit effects and plenty of AD, Ruunans will spread those onhit effects, Navoiri will allow you to use your on hit effects more often
yeah people don't think, that's why.
I got both dragons and 6 grubs
the kayn was bad, but our toplaner refused to go into sidelanes and use the grubs, our midlaner never moved to invade with me or follow up out of spite so it was just gg
well the kayn had a winning mid and top
I was ahead cs xp and objectives
this spike should feel very good
ruunans 2nd item
oh wow, you have damage xD
you do, only reason you killed him is because of the bring it down passive
read the passive
are you sure?
what does the bing it down passive do?
no read it again
okay big spike here
you will build LDR 4th item
unfortunate, just from watching, the build looks a lot better alreadyu tbh
anyways, gotta go to work. good luck brother
