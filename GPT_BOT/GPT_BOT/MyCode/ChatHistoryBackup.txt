My support got banned and now they're working on figuring out who they want to play, but I likely will be playing my main champion. Oh, my support is playing a mid range. Mage type burst champion that also can have heavy CC and I am against one of the strongest. Bot lanes up front in damage. But they require scaling and have no mobility."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Facing a Yasuo in lane can be quite the challenge, but don't worry, we've got this. With a burst mage support, you'll need to communicate well and coordinate your engages to capitalize on their CC potential. Make sure to play safe early on, respect Yasuo's all-ins, and look for opportunities to poke and trade efficiently.\n\nSince your bot lane duo scales well and lacks mobility, focus on farming safely and scaling up for mid to late-game team fights. Keep an eye on the map, maintain good vision, and be ready to follow up on your support's engages.\n\nAs the game progresses, prioritize your positioning and stay aware of Yasuo's key abilities, like his Wind Wall. Look for opportunities to outmaneuver and outplay him with your kiting abilities.\n\nRemember, communication and synergy with your support will be crucial in navigating this matchup.

Here are a few tips to help you navigate through a jungle gap situation:\n\n1. **Ward Smart:** Place wards strategically to track the enemy jungler's movements and avoid ganks. Vision is key to prevent getting caught out unnecessarily.\n\n2. **Play Safe:** If your jungle is struggling, it's essential to play a bit more defensively. Focus on farming safely and avoid risky plays that could put you at a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Communicate:** Keep an open line of communication with your team. Politely suggest objectives, rotations, or plays that could help turn the game around. Teamwork can make a huge difference.\n\n4. **Focus on Objectives:** If your jungle is struggling, prioritize objectives like Dragon or Rift Herald to secure important buffs for your team. Coordination and map control can help alleviate the jungle gap.\n\n5. **Stay Positive:** Remember that every game is a learning experience. Keep a positive attitude, encourage your team, and focus on what you can do to contribute to a potential comeback.\n\nIn challenging situations like these, staying cool-headed, adapting your gameplay, and supporting your team can make a difference.

However, I can share some insights about a popular ADC champion like Jinx, for example:\n\n**Champion: Jinx**\n- **Passive - Get Excited!:** Jinx gains bonus movement speed and attack speed whenever she takes down an enemy champion or tower.\n- **Q - Switcheroo!:** Jinx switches between her minigun, Pow-Pow, for high-speed attacks, and her rocket launcher, Fishbones, for splash damage and increased range.\n- **W - Zap!:** Jinx fires a shock blast that damages and slows enemies hit.\n- **E - Flame Chompers!:** Jinx sets a trap that explodes and roots enemies that walk over it.\n- **R - Super Mega Death Rocket!:** Jinx fires a massive rocket that deals damage to enemies based on missing health.\n\nAs for their cooldowns and details, remember to check the League of Legends client or website for the most accurate and up-to-date information. When playing Jinx, focus on positioning, timing your abilities, and utilizing her strong AoE damage in team fights to secure victory.\n\nNow, let's delve into your gameplay and see how you can apply strategies like a pro on the Rift!
